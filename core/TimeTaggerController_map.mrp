Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net test_generator/lut_input<1>
   is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the
   CE pin to control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

   is configured to use input parity pins. There are dangling output parity
   pins.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:243 - Logical network ok1<29> has no load.
INFO:LIT:395 - The above info message is repeated 115 more times for the
   following (max. 5 shown):
   okPipe/ep_blockstrobe,
   ep01/ep_dataout<15>,
   ep01/ep_dataout<14>,

   ep01/ep_dataout<12>
   To see the details of these info messages, please use the -detail switch.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celsius. (default - Range:
   -40.000 to 100.000 Celsius)

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 272 block(s) removed
 403 block(s) optimized away
 285 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Section 10 - Timing Report
--------------------------
A logic-level (pre-route) timing report can be generated by using Xilinx static
timing analysis tools, Timing Analyzer (GUI) or TRCE (command line), with the
mapped NCD and PCF files. Please note that this timing report will be generated
using estimated delay information. For accurate numbers, please generate a
timing report with the post Place and Route NCD file.

For more information about the Timing Analyzer, consult the Xilinx Timing
Analyzer Reference Manual; for more information about TRCE, consult the Xilinx
Command Line Tools User Guide "TRACE" chapter.
